				<h2>Django MultiHost</h2>
				<p>
					I know it's not a Django site, but it's just as important. This allows us, the class, to host all the groups' sites under one hostname &mdash; something that is far more complicated than it should be. IT can also be easily adapted for hosting multiple personal projects of your own on your server.

				<h2>A Guide to The Galaxy</h2>
				<p>
					We're onto the big one. This is (as far as I can tell) our final for this class. It's a fully fleshed-out Django site of our choosing. For this, our group decided to make a space travel agency. It's still under heavy development.

				<h2>Newspaper</h2>
				<p>
					Our next project was to build a newspaper app. What I've made is <i>mostly</i> fleshed out, but it is missing a few polishing touches here and there. It's a perfectly functional (if rather bare) "newspaper"... thing.

				<h2>Forms and User Accounts</h2>
				<p>
					User accounts! That's the magic word. See, I'm a homelabber, and a lot of the services I run use Django, which integrates very cleanly with OIDC-compatbile IdPs via <a href="https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">django-allauth</a>. I have a project that I would love to turn into a web app that integrates cleanly with my SSO IdP. This project brings me one step closer to that goal.

				<h2>Blog Website</h2>
				<p>
					This was a less simple project, but fun. We started to get more in the weeds, dealing with more ORM and user stuff, but adding <span class="sparkle">styling</span>. I chose to style with <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sass</a> for its flexibility. I've used Sass in prior projects, but I want to get more familiar with it.

			<div class="project" id="message-board">
				<h2>Message Board</h2>
				<p>
					This was an excellent continuation down the Django path. We set up the admin app for the first time and learned how to edit the site's content through there. In this case, we configured it such that the posts could be added, edited, and removed through the admin app.

				<h2>Company Website</h2>
				<p>
					For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a website using Django for a fictional company with a few pages, one of which must be populated based on the context given in that page's view.

			<div class="project" id="personal-website">
				<h2>Personal Website</h2>
				<p>
					This one was a pretty simple project. We needed to create a basic website with Django to demonstrate our learning thus far. In this case, it was a simple static page with the word "Homepage".
