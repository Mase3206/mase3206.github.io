				<h2>Message Board</h2>
				<p>
					This was an excellent continuation down the Django path. We set up the admin app for the first time and learned how to edit the site's content through there. In this case, we configured it such that the posts could be added, edited, and removed through the admin app.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fun tidbit that we learned: Django was originally intended to be an online news management system.

				<h2>Personal Website</h2>
				<p>
					This one was a pretty simple project. We needed to create a basic website with Django to demonstrate our learning thus far. In this case, it was a simple static page with the word "Homepage".
